# Safe-Browsing-From-School
Want to know why you can't watch YouTube? Or why the stupid extensions follows you home even though you're not at school? Answer's simple and the solution is simpler.

I'm only doing this as a hobby! Not as an actual up-to-date work! During my free time, or by request, I'll spend some of my free time releasing helpful advice or files...

Back to the issue at hand: Are you facing a problem with your schooloogle account (school google account) when you are trying to watch a youtube video thats ACTUALLY for educational purposes? Or certain websites are blocked because "It HaS bEeN bLoCkeD bY yOuR AdMiNisTaRtOr", knowing quite well that you're at home and want to go into this website? Or maybe it's settings you don't want on your personal computer to have from school? The fix is to press DO NO SYNC during the promt where it asks you, "Would you like to enable sync and download account information tied with it?". This setting in a way is telling you, "Would you like to sign in (good) AND have everything else along with settings, bookmarks, and settings, ect... to be installed to your computer (BAD)?". By saying no, it will allow you to sign into google applications, have the flexabilty to use multiple accounts, and enjoy that ability to not have to deal with unwanted things to be installed. Signing in into google classroom will work, along with google drive and other stuff.

Now for the troubleshooting stuff.

Q: I've signned in WITH sync and I want to remove this school profile so that I don't have to deal with these issues mentioned above, what should I do?

A: Go to the google page where it tells you, "Who's using google?", go to the top right part on the box of the user, there should be a three dot stack, click on that, click delete, and delete everything related to the profile.

Q: I've deleted it now. But Now I want to sign back in to use google classroom. How to do that?

A: You're going to need to make a new profile (or if you'd perfer, use a profile that has another account), and during the part that tells you would you like to sign in, press no or skip this process. Go to google classroom, sign in with your google classroom, press NO, I'm not interested in mergeing accounts or something along those lines after you sign into google classroom. And that's all!

Q: It works now! But my youtube doesn't work. Why?

A: Cookies My friend. If you are getting the issue that yotube has been restricted or blocked, it simply means that your google account was automatically signed into youtube. To remove this issue, go into cookies (the button near the url, looks like two dots with lines coming out from them, then cookies and site data) and delete the two youtube cookies by clicking the trash can icon found on the right of them. Once done, hit refresh, and it should still tell your that there's an error/blocked/restricted. That's okay. remove the current url on your search bar, and simply type wwww.youtube.com, and boom. No more issue.

Q: I did it all, but I'm still worried about my privacy.

A: If you still are worried about the conern of privacy, just sign in from an incognito tab. Three dots on the main google chrome home page (of an user), and click incongito. Or, press ctrl + shift + n to quickly open one. From there, you can browse safely (Just don't do anything stupid in there. Yes, it acts like a barrier, but it can be seen by "...Your internet service provider." and other stuff. Just do your research for incognito.)

Q: I still have some questions. Can I contact you?

A: Sure. For now, only in person stuff. Don't know me? Sorry, no can do YET. I still gotta figure this thing out ngl.
